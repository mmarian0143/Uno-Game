# Uno Game Application 

This Uno Game application was developed as part of a course project at Grand Canyon University. It features backend game logic and an API built with Java, while the front-end is created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is deployed to Heroku, allowing players to enjoy the Uno experience from anywhere.
